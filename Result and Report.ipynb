    "# COMP8420 Assignment 2: Personal Travel Assistant\n",
    "## Results and Report\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report documents the development of a Personal Travel Assistant application as part of the COMP8420 Assignment 2. The application leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences and inputs. The system comprises three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LLM Setup**: Configuration of both public API and local language models as the intelligence backbone\n",
    "2. **Dialogue System**: An automated conversation flow to collect user preferences and requirements\n",
    "3. **Frontend Interface**: A user-friendly web application for interacting with the travel planning system\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective was to create an end-to-end solution that demonstrates the practical application of NLP techniques in a real-world scenario while delivering tangible value to users planning their travels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. LLM Setup and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Model Selection and Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I implemented a dual-model approach to provide users with options and to enable comparison between different LLM implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Public API Integration (OpenAI)**\n",
    "- Utilized the OpenAI API with the GPT-3.5-Turbo model\n",
    "- Implemented proper error handling and response formatting\n",
    "- Created a lightweight client for efficient API communication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local LLM Deployment (Llama 3.2)**\n",
    "- Successfully deployed Llama 3.2 locally using Ollama\n",
    "- Configured API endpoints for local model access\n",
    "- Implemented connection management and timeout handling\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual-model approach allows for:\n",
    "1. Comparison between different LLM architectures\n",
    "2. Fallback options if one service is unavailable\n",
    "3. Different response styles (concise vs. detailed) to suit user preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize the LLM responses for travel planning, I developed specialized prompts that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structure the input data in a consistent format\n",
    "- Request specific output formats (day-by-day itineraries, budgeting, etc.)\n",
    "- Include specific instructions for handling different travel scenarios\n",
    "- Maintain a personalized tone while delivering structured content\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of the constructed travel prompt:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def construct_travel_prompt(user_responses):\n",
    "    return f\"\"\"\n",
    "    I need to create a personalized travel itinerary based on the following information:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Personal Information: {user_responses.get('personal_info', 'Not provided')}\n",
    "    Travel Destination: {user_responses.get('travel_destination', 'Not provided')}\n",
    "    Travel Dates/Duration: {user_responses.get('travel_dates', 'Not provided')}\n",
    "    Budget: {user_responses.get('budget', 'Not provided')}\n",
    "    Interests: {user_responses.get('interests', 'Not provided')}\n",
    "    Accommodation Preference: {user_responses.get('accommodation_preference', 'Not provided')}\n",
    "    Dietary Restrictions: {user_responses.get('dietary_restrictions', 'Not provided')}\n",
    "    Additional Information: {user_responses.get('additional_info', 'Not provided')}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Based on this information, please create a detailed travel itinerary that includes:\n",
    "    1. Day-by-day schedule with activities and attractions\n",
    "    2. Recommended accommodations within their budget\n",
    "    3. Suggested dining options that match their preferences and dietary needs\n",
    "    4. Estimated costs for the major components of the trip\n",
    "    5. Practical travel tips specific to their destination and preferences\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Format the itinerary in a clear, organized manner with headings and subheadings. \n",
    "    The itinerary should be well-structured, personalized to their interests, and respectful of their budget constraints.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dialogue System Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Dialogue Flow Design\n",
    "\n",
    "I designed a structured dialogue flow to collect essential travel information from users in a conversational manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction**: Welcome message and explanation of the service\n",
    "2. **Personal Information**: Basic details about the traveler(s)\n",
    "3. **Destination Selection**: Primary travel location\n",
    "4. **Travel Dates and Duration**: Timing and length of trip\n",
    "5. **Budget Information**: Financial constraints and expectations\n",
    "6. **Travel Interests**: Activities and experiences preferences\n",
    "7. **Accommodation Preferences**: Lodging type and requirements\n",
    "8. **Dietary Restrictions**: Food preferences and limitations\n",
    "9. **Additional Information**: Any other relevant details\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dialogue stage was implemented with:\n",
    "- Clear, conversational prompts\n",
    "- Input validation where appropriate\n",
    "- Optional/required status indicators\n",
    "- Example responses for user guidance\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The system processes user responses through several stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collection**: Gathering structured data through the dialogue flow\n",
    "2. **Validation**: Ensuring required fields are completed\n",
    "3. **Normalization**: Formatting responses for LLM consumption\n",
    "4. **Contextualization**: Building a comprehensive prompt with all user data\n",
    "5. **Refinement**: Allowing iterative improvements to the generated plan\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 Response Generation and Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented a flexible response system that allows users to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate initial travel plans based on their preferences\n",
    "- Compare plans from different LLM models\n",
    "- Refine plans with specific requests\n",
    "- Export completed itineraries in different formats\n",
    "\n",
    "The refinement system uses a specialized prompt structure that maintains the context of the original plan while incorporating user feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def refine_travel_plan(original_plan, refinement_request, model=\"openai\"):\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"\n",
    "    Original travel plan:\n",
    "    {original_plan}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    User requested refinements:\n",
    "    {refinement_request}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Please provide an improved travel plan addressing these specific requests while maintaining the original structure.\n",
    "    Make the changes seamlessly so the plan still reads as a cohesive whole.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Generate refined plan using selected model\n",
    "    if model == \"openai\":\n",
    "        return query_openai_api(prompt)\n",
    "    elif model == \"llama\":\n",
    "        return query_local_llama(prompt)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"Error: Invalid model specified\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
